PLUGIN_DESCRIPTION

Change the HTML title and META robots fields for all post types and taxonomies.

Content editing allows you to set a meta value for the page title and description, posts, and content types.

The configuration allows you to set the default values of the "robots" meta field for pages, entries, attachments, and your content types.
